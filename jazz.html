			<h3>Background</h3>
			<img id="jazzImg" src="Graphics/jazz.jpg">
			<p>Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, 
			United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. 
			Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized 
			as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular 
			musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage 
			with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, 
			polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American 
			music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. 
			Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as "one of America's original art forms".

			As jazz spread around the world, it drew on different national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave 
			rise to many distinctive styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, 
			French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. In the 1930s, 
			heavily arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz, a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational 
			style and Gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 
			1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played at 
			faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, 
			smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.

			The 1950s saw the emergence of free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures, 
			and in the mid-1950s, hard bop emerged, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues, 
			especially in the saxophone and piano playing. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, 
			as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining 
			jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, 
			a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles 
			and genres abound in the 2000s, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.</p>
			
			<h3>The Jazz Age</h3>
			<img id="trumpet" src="Graphics/trumpet.jpg">
			<p>From 1920 to 1933, Prohibition in the United States banned the sale of alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies 
			which became lively venues of the "Jazz Age", hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty songs, and show tunes. Jazz began 
			to get a reputation as immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by 
			promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s. Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote, "... it is not music at all. 
			It's merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion." The New York Times 
			reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but the villagers had used pots and pans; another story 
			claimed that the fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.Despite its Southern black origins, there 
			was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra became a hit 
			in San Francisco. He signed a contract with Victor and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white 
			component, hiring white musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Frankie Trumbauer, and Joe Venuti. 
			In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be 
			recognized as a notable musical form. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote, "This composition 
			shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a 
			form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the 
			whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated 
			and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener."

			After Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, 
			including Fred Waring, Jean Goldkette, and Nathaniel Shilkret. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a 
			"rhetoric of domestication" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read "white") a previously inchoate 
			(read "black") kind of music. Whiteman's success caused blacks to follow suit, including Earl Hines (who opened in The 
			Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928), Duke Ellington (who opened at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1927), Lionel Hampton, 
			Fletcher Henderson, Claude Hopkins, and Don Redman, with Henderson and Redman developing the "talking to one another" formula 
			for "hot" Swing music.

			In 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as featured soloist. The original New Orleans 
			style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown 
			style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on 
			arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, 
			rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman 
			Hawkins), sounded "stiff, stodgy," with "jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality." The following example shows
			a short excerpt of the straight melody of "Mandy, Make Up Your Mind" by George W. Meyer and Arthur Johnston (top), compared 
			with Armstrong's solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924). Armstrong's solos were a significant factor in making jazz a
			true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson's group, Armstrong formed his Hot Five band, where he popularized scat singing.</p>
