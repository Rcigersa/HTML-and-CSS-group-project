<center><i><b>Blues</b></i> is a music genre and musical form originated in the Deep South of the United States around the 1870s. The genre developed from roots, and spirituals.
Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll,
is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. 
Blue notes (or<u>worried notes</u>;), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. 
Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the groove.
Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early traditional blues verses consisted of a single line repeated four times. 
It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_form" target="_blank">AAB pattern</a>, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, 
its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative,
often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans. Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, 
can be traced back to the music of Africa. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, 
the spirituals. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the ending of slavery and, later, the development of juke joints. 
It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. 
The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres.
Blues subgenres include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_blues" target="_blank"><i>Country blues</i></a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_blues" target="_blank"><i>Delta blues</i></a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_blues" target="_blank"><i>Piedmont blues</i></a>,as well as urban blues styles such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_blues" target="_blank"><i>Chicago blues</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_blues" target="_blank"><i>West Coast blues</i></a>. 
World War II marked the transition from acoustic to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_blues" target="_blank"><i>Electric blues</i></a> and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_rock" target="_blank"><i>blues Rock</i></a> developed, which blended blues styles with rock music.</center>

The <i><u>first publication</u></i> of blues sheet music may have been <i>"I Got the Blues"</i>, published by New Orleans musician Antonio Maggio in 1908 and described 
as "the earliest published composition known to link the condition of having the blues to the musical form that would become popularly known as 'the blues.
Hart Wand's <i>"Dallas Blues"</i> was published in 1912; W.C. Handy's <i>"The Memphis Blues"</i> followed in the same year. The first recording by an African American singer was Mamie Smith's 1920
rendition of Perry Bradford's <i>"Crazy Blues"</i>. But the origins of the blues were some decades earlier, probably around 1890.This music is poorly documented, 
partly because of racial discrimination in U.S. society, including academic circles,and partly because of the low rate of literacy among rural African Americans at the time.
Reports of blues music in southern Texas and the Deep South were written at the dawn of the 20th century. Charles Peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at Clarksdale, 
Mississippi, and Gate Thomas reported similar songs in southern Texas around 1901–1902. These observations coincide more or less with the recollections of Jelly Roll Morton, 
who said he first heard blues music in New Orleans in 1902; Ma Rainey, who remembered first hearing the blues in the same year in Missouri; and W.C. Handy, who first heard the blues in Tutwiler,
Mississippi, in 1903. The <b>first extensive research </b> in the field was performed by Howard W. Odum, who published an anthology of folk songs from Lafayette County, Mississippi, and Newton County, 
Georgia, between 1905 and 1908.The first noncommercial recordings of blues music, termed proto-blues by Paul Oliver, were made by Odum for research purposes at the very beginning of the 20th century.
They are now lost.

<img src="Graphics/51.jpg" width="350">
<p>
Why is blues music called “the blues”? The name of this great American music probably originated with the 17th-century English expression “the blue devils,” 
for the intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal. Shortened over time to “the blues,” it came to mean a state of agitation or 
depression. “Blue” was slang for “drunk” by the 1800s. The link between “blue” and drinking is also indicated by “blue laws” that still prohibit Sunday alcohol 
sales in some states. By the turn of the century, a couple’s dance that involved slowly grinding the hips together called “the blues” or “the slow drag” was popular 
in Southern juke joints. A rural juke would be jammed on weekends with couples getting their drink on, doing the pre-coital shuffle to the accompaniment of a “bluesman” on guitar.
Today, musicians play “the blues” in the twelve-bar format introduced by William C. Handy in his 1912 sheet music “Memphis Blues.”  But as bluesman “Little” Milton Campbell, 
Jr. explained during our interview for my book The Language of the Blues: From Alcorub to Zuzu: <i>“W.C. Handy created sequences — verse, chorus, et cetera. But the old 
timers didn’t really play that way. John Lee Hooker, he didn’t play by bars, he didn’t count — he just made a change whenever he felt like it. He didn’t necessarily rhyme 
all his words, neither. Whatever he was thinking, whatever came up, that’s what he was singing. I think Handy was trying his best to make the songs seem as professional as 
possible, yet also simple to play, so he put bars to the music where you could count. Twelve bars with a turn-back.”</i>
