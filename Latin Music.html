Latin music (Portuguese and Spanish: m√∫sica latina) is a genre used by the music industry as a catch-all term for music that comes from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking areas of the world, namely Ibero America, Spain and Portugal, as well as music sung in either language.
In the United States, the music industry defines Latin music as any recording sung mostly in Spanish regardless of its genre or the artist's nationality.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Billboard magazine use this definition of Latin music to track sales of Spanish-language records in the US.
Spain, Brazil, Mexico and the United States are the largest Latin music markets in the world.

Since the late 1990s, the US has had a substantially rising population of "Latinos", a term popularized since the 1960s due to the wrong and confusing use of the term "Spanish" and the more proper but less popular term "Hispanic".
A great part of the English-speaking media started to refer to any kind of music featuring Spanish vocals as "Latin music".

Major record labels such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music often have two divisions dedicated to the Latin market: 
one which focuses on Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula,[16] and the other for the Hispanic market in the United States. 
Since 1990, Billboard has held the Latin Music Conference every year. The week-long conference features speakers including key personnel such as 
executives and producers from the Latin music industry and notable artists in the Latin music scene. The conference concludes with the annual
 Billboard Latin Music Awards.[18] In 2000, the Latin Recording Academy inaugurated the Latin Grammy Awards to recognize musicians who perform in 
 Spanish or Portuguese.[19] The awards mainly encompass music from Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and the United States. 
 The Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 2012 to recognize songwriters from Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking regions around the world.
