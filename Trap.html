<p>Trap music is defined by its ominous, bleak and gritty lyrical content which varies widely according to the artist. 
Typical lyrical themes portrayed include observations of hardship in the "trap", street life, poverty, violence and harsh experiences that artists have faced in their urban surroundings.</p>

Whether you love it or hate it, trap music is everywhere. It has become a staple of the hip hop world, constantly topping the charts thanks to rappers like <b>Future, 2 Chainz</b> and <b>Migos</b>. Not limited to genre, it has found its way onto the EDM scene, gaining popularity with electronic music producers <b>Diplo, TNGHT, Bro Safari</b> and <b>DJ Snake</b>. Trap beats have even entered the mainstream pop music world, where elements of trap can be heard in <b>Katy Perry’s</b> <i>'Dark Horse'</i> or <b>Miley Cyrus’</b> fourth studio album <i>Bangerz</i>. Despite its recent popularity, the hip hop subgenre isn’t anything new, emerging from the Southern rap scene in the late '90s. Trap music is characterised by the predominant use of <u>808 bass, rapid-fire hi-hats, crisp snares and layered synths</u>. The term trap was coined in Atlanta and comes straight from the streets, with trap literally meaning a drug house where dealers buy, sell, produce and use illegal narcotics.  During this time, rappers who spoke about drug dealing were known as trap rappers, including <b>UGK, 8Ball</b> and <b>Three 6 Mafia</b>. Lately, the origins of trap music have been disputed, with hip hop legends <b>T.I</b> and <b>Gucci Mane</b> claiming they are the rightful inventors. Earlier this month, Gucci Mane posted a throwback Instagram post claiming he invented trap music with his 2005 album, <i>Trap House</i>. T.I was bound to set the record straight and shut down Gucci Mane’s proposal. The 37-year-old rapper posted a message to ‘the slow ones in the back’; stating he was the pioneer of trap rap, launching the subgenre with his second album <i>Trap Muzik</i> in 2003. Rap fans have also joined the debate. Although T.I dropped his first album two years earlier, Gucci Mane is better known for his trap beats. And don’t forget about <b>Jeezy</b> who launched trap music into the mainstream with his 2005 song <i>'Trap Star'</i>. If we look even further into the past, the first song to mention <i>trap</i> was, in fact, <b>Goodie Mob’s</b> 1995 track ‘Thought Process’. The term was also used in <b>Outkast’s</b> 1998 song ‘SpottieOttieDopaliscious’,  And of course, before trap, there was crunk. Crunk emerged in the early ‘90s and gained mainstream success during the mid-2000s. Who remembers Three 6 Mafia’s 'Tear Da Club Up?' Or <b>Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz</b> <i>Get Crunk: Who U Wit: Da Album?</i> Crunk was known for its heavy 808 bass and synthesized instruments. The growing interest in crunk outside the southern hip hop scene eventually led to the development in trap music.

<p>Aubrey Drake Graham<i>(born October 24, 1986)</i> known mononymously as Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur.
His rapping ability has been noted as "polarizing", and has contributed to him being named one of the most divisive rappers of his generation by multiple critics and media publications.
Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The <u>Next Generation</u> in the early 2000s. 
Intent on pursuing a career as a rapper, he departed the series in 2007 following the release of his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement. 
He released two further independent projects, Comeback Season and So Far Gone, before signing to Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment in June 2009.
Drake released his debut studio album Thank Me Later in 2010,which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 and was soon certified platinum.
His next two releases, 2011's Take Care and 2013's Nothing Was the Same,were critically and commercially successful; the former earned him his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.
In 2015, he released two mixtapes—the trap-influenced If You're Reading This It's Too Late and a collaboration with Future titled What a Time to Be Alive—both 
of which earned platinum certification in the U.S.
His fourth album, Views (2016), broke several chart records.The dancehall-influenced album sat atop the Billboard 200 for 13 nonconsecutive weeks,
becoming the first album by a male solo artist to do so in over 10 years. The album's second single, "One Dance", topped the charts in several countries,
and became his first number-one single as a lead artist. That year, Drake led both the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 charts simultaneously for eight weeks.
Views achieved quadruple platinum status in the US, and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release.
Its lead single <b>"Hotline Bling"</b> received Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song. In 2017, he released the mixtape More Life. Described by Drake as a "playlist",
it became his seventh consecutive number one on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. A year later, he released the double album Scorpion, 
which also broke several streaming records, and housed the number-one singles "God's Plan", and the bounce-infused "Nice for What" and "In My Feelings".
Drake holds several Billboard chart records. He has the most charted songs (186) among solo artists in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, the most simultaneously charted Hot 100 songs in a single
week (27), the most time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks) and the most Hot 100 debuts in a week (22). He also has the most number one singles on the Hot Rap Songs, 
Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and Rhythmic Charts. Drake has also won three Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, and fifteen Billboard Music Awards. 
He is the RIAA's top certified digital singles artist and one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 95 million records sold globally. 
As an entrepreneur, <i>Drake has founded the OVO Sound record label with longtime collaborator 40, as well as using the "OVO" moniker to create a clothing line and program on Beats 1 Radio.</i></p>
