			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as 
			"rock and roll" in the United States in the early 1950s, and developed 
			into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in 
			the United Kingdom and in the United States. It has its roots in 1940s and 
			1950s rock and roll, a style which drew heavily on the genres of blues, 
			rhythm and blues, and from country music. Rock music also drew strongly 
			on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated
			influences from jazz, classical and other musical styles. Musically, rock 
			has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with 
			electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. Typically, rock is song-based
			music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verseâ€“chorus 
			form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics 
			often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes 
			that are frequently social or political.

			By the late 1960s "classic rock" period, a number of distinct rock music 
			subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country
			rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of 
			psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie
			scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic 
			elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse 
			and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the 
			second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social 
			and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and 
			eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music 
			and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further
			fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and 
			rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage 
			rock/post-punk and techno-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.

			Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social 
			movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the 
			hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 
			1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition 
			of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes 
			in social attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt 
			against adult consumerism and conformity.</p>
			
			<h3>The 1950's: Rock and Roll</h3>
			<p>The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States 
			during the late 1940s and early 1950s, and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. 
			Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time, including 
			rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and western. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey 
			Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed "race music") for a multi-racial audience, 
			and is credited with first using the phrase "rock and roll" to describe the music.

			Debate surrounds which record should be considered the first rock and roll record. Contenders include 
			Goree Carter's "Rock Awhile" (1949); Jimmy Preston's "Rock the Joint" (1949), which was later covered by 
			Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952; and "Rocket 88" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (in fact, Ike Turner 
			and his band the Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in 1951. Four years later, Bill Haley's 
			"Rock Around the Clock" (1955) became the first rock and roll song to top Billboard magazine's main sales and 
			airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture.</p>

			<h3>Indie Rock</h3>
			<p>In the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably. By the mid-1990s, as elements 
			of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge and 
			pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning. Those bands following the less commercial contours 
			of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie. They characteristically attempted to retain 
			control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying on 
			touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion. Linked by an 
			ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged,
			grunge-influenced bands like the Cranberries and Superchunk, through do-it-yourself experimental bands 
			like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. It has been noted that indie rock has a 
			relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified 
			by the development of feminist-informed Riot Grrrl music.[220] Many countries have developed an extensive
			local indie scene, flourishing with bands with enough popularity to survive inside the respective country,
			but virtually unknown outside them.</p>
