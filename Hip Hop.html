in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming 
speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: <i><b>MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, 
break dancing, and graffiti writing</b></i>. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records, and rhythmic beatboxing. While often used to refer solely to 
rapping, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping 
is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of hip hop culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and this

<h2 class="city">New school hip hop</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_school_hip_hop"></a>
<p>
The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. 
As with the hip hop preceding it <i>(which subsequently became known as old school hip hop)</i>, the new school came predominately from New York City. 
The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine-led minimalism, with influences from rock music, a hip hop "metal music for the 80's-a hard-edge 
ugly/beauty trance as desperate and stimulating as New York itself. "It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, 
both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted 
sharply with the funk and disco-influenced hip hop groups, whose pre-1984 music was characterized by novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and "party rhymes" 
<i>(not all artists prior to 1984 had these styles)</i>. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and they produced more cohesive LP 
albums than their old school counterparts. By 1986, their releases began to establish the hip-hop album as a fixture of mainstream music. Hip hop music became commercially 
successful, as exemplified by the Beastie Boys' 1986 album Licensed to Ill, which was the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts.

<h2 class="city">A$AP Rocky</h2>
<img src="Graphics/asap.jpg" alt="A$AP" title="A$AP" width="500">
<p>In a meeting of two musicians whose work you might describe as <i>“well-crafted and stylish,”</i> <b>A$AP Rocky</b> has released a new song that heavily 
samples Tame Impala. It’s called “Sundress,” and it’s built around an instrumental loop and a variation of the vocal melody from the Australian psych-pop band’s 
Innerspeaker album cut <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_Uk5SrE5tE">“Why Won’t You Make Up Your Mind?”</a></i>“Sundress” comes about six months after Rocky’s 
third studio album Testing, and is the first solo song he’s released since that record. According to Spotify’s credits, it was produced in part by Danger Mouse, and it bears 
some traces of his dense and nocturnal sound. As HotNewHipHop points out, the track was leaked online several weeks ago, and Rocky subsequently performed it live at Odd Future’s 
Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival festival earlier this month. (Another new song debuted at Flog Gnaw, potentially called “Shittin’ Me,” has not yet been officially released.)
The song comes with an impressive music video, which uses Mannequin Challenge-style freezes in the action and clever flashbacks to illustrate a scene of nightclub 
violence, with a genuinely surprising twist ending. Previously, Rocky released a video for his Testing track “Fukk Sleep,” a collaboration with FKA Twigs. Watch the 
“Sundress” video below.</p>
