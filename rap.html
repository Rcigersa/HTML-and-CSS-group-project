			<h3>Background</h3>
			<img id="mikeImg" src="Graphics/mike.jpg">
			<p>Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates 
			"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular", which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, 
			usually over a backbeat or musical accompaniment. The components of rap include "content" (what is being said),
			"flow" (rhythm, rhyme), and "delivery" (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that rap 
			is usually performed in time to an instrumental track. Rap is often associated with, and is a primary 
			ingredient of hip-hop music, but the origins of the phenomenon predate hip-hop culture. The earliest 
			precursor to the modern rap is the West African griot tradition, in which "oral historians", or "praise-singers",
			would disseminate oral traditions and genealogies, or use their formidable rhetorical techniques for gossip 
			or to "praise or critique individuals." Griot traditions connect to rap along a lineage of Black verbal 
			reverence that goes back to ancient Egyptian practices, through James Brown interacting with the crowd 
			and the band between songs, to Muhammad Ali's quick-witted verbal taunts and the palpitating poems of 
			the Last Poets. Therefore, rap lyrics and music are part of the "Black rhetorical continuum", and aim 
			to reuse elements of past traditions while expanding upon them through "creative use of language and 
			rhetorical styles and strategies. The person credited with originating the style of "delivering 
			rhymes over extensive music", that would become known as rap, was Anthony "DJ Hollywood" Holloway from 
			Harlem, New York.</p>
			
			<h3>Golden Age</h3>
			<img id="smithImg" src="Graphics/smith.jpg">
			<p>Golden age hip hop (the mid-1980s to early '90s) was the time period where hip-hop lyricism went through 
			its most drastic transformation – writer William Jelani Cobb says "in these golden years, a critical 
			mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time" and Allmusic 
			writes, "rhymers like PE's Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Rakim basically invented the complex 
			wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop". The golden age is considered to have ended around 1993–94, 
			marking the end of rap lyricism's most innovative period.</p>
			
			<h3>Freestyle and Battling</h3>
			
			<p>There are two kinds of freestyle rap: one is scripted (recitation), but having no particular overriding 
			subject matter, the second typically referred to as "freestyling" or "spitting", is the improvisation of 
			rapped lyrics. When freestyling, some rappers inadvertently reuse old lines, or even "cheat" by preparing 
			segments or entire verses in advance. Therefore, freestyles with proven spontaneity are valued above generic, 
			always usable lines. Rappers will often reference places or objects in their immediate setting, or specific 
			(usually demeaning) characteristics of opponents, to prove their authenticity and originality.

			Battle rapping, which can be freestyled, is the competition between two or more rappers in front of an audience. 
			The tradition of insulting one's friends or acquaintances in rhyme goes back to the dozens, and was portrayed famously 
			by Muhammad Ali in his boxing matches. The winner of a battle is decided by the crowd and/or preselected judges. 
			According to Kool Moe Dee, a successful battle rap focuses on an opponent's weaknesses, rather than one's own strengths. 
			Television shows such as MTV's DFX and BET's 106 and Park host weekly freestyle battles live on the air. Battle rapping 
			gained widespread public recognition outside of the African-American community with rapper Eminem's movie 8 Mile.

			The strongest battle rappers will generally perform their rap fully freestyled. This is the most effective form in a 
			battle as the rapper can comment on the other person, whether it be what they look like, or how they talk, or what they 
			wear. It also allows the rapper to reverse a line used to "diss" him or her if they are the second rapper to battle. 
			This is known as a "flip". Jin The Emcee was considered "World Champion" battle rapper in the mid-2000s.</p>
